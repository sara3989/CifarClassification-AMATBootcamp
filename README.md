# CifarClassification-AMATBootcamp
## Overview
This project is a comprehensive exploration of image classification using CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. It encompasses the entire project lifecycle, from data preparation to constructing a custom CNN model and deploying it with monitoring capabilities. The project was undertaken within the framework of a boot camp hosted by Applied Materials.

#### Dataset Preparation 
* Downloaded the CIFAR-10 dataset.
* Integrated labels from CIFAR-100 and a custom captured dataset.
* Applied data augmentation techniques to balance the data.
* Resampled custom images to align with CIFAR data.
* Ensured data quality and suitability for neural networks.

## Data Analysis
* Conducted an in-depth analysis of the merged dataset.
* Split the data into training, validation, and test sets for model development and evaluation.

## Modeling with Pytorch
* Developed a custom neural network from the ground up.
* Analyzed model training results, including convergence graphs, accuracy, and confusion matrices.

## Out Of Distribution Data Handling
* Demonstrated a deep understanding of the topic, experimenting with various methods to achieve 
  the desired results.
  
## Inference and Evaluation
* Evaluated model inference on test data.
* Visualized correctly and incorrectly classified examples with probabilities.
* Presented a confusion matrix to evaluate model performance.
  
## GUI
* Implemented a user-friendly Dash interface.
* Enabled users to upload images from their devices or use their device cameras.
* Allow user provide feedback about prediction (for monitoring model perfomance).

## Development Environment
* project developed using PyCharm.
* Training model on Kaggle for powerfull GPU performance
